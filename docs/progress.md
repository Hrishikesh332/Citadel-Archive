- Replaced the sensitive 2D knowledge mesh force simulation with a deterministic
  Three.js 3D scene.
- Added restrained orbit and zoom controls, fixed camera bounds, stable node
  placement, and WebGL labels for the mesh.
- Vendored the Three.js browser modules under `kb/static/vendor/` so the hosted
  UI does not depend on a runtime CDN.
- Verified backend tests with `uv run pytest` and checked the 3D canvas with
  Playwright on desktop and mobile viewports.
